# wallpaper-repository
• Just some wallpapers, you can add some if you like!

• Plug yourself here if you've contributed.

• You can leave sources of wallpapers(artist handles, deviant art links etc.) in the README.

• ~~Since we have not sorted out the wallpapers it is recommended to clone this repository and browse through it using an image viewer.~~ Took me like 30 minutes to sort everything - onion
